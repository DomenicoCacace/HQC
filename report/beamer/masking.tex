\begin{frame}{Side Channel Attacks}
    Implementations of theoretically secure cryptosystems may \textit{leak} some information, allowing an 
    attacker to extract secret data.
    \begin{block}{Side Channel Vulnerabilities}
        Side channel attacks take use of different leakage sources, such as:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Execution time
            \item Power consumption
            \item Electromagnetic radiation
            \item Differential faults
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Power Analysis}
    \begin{block}{Simple Power Analysis}
        Analyze the electrical current drawn by the device over time: different operations may have different power consumption.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Differential Power Analysis}
        Statistically analyze the power consumption of the device over different executions: detect biases between, for example, a known secret key and a unknown one.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Countermeasures to Power Analysis}
    Power analysis attacks are usually passive, so they cannot be detected by the device.
    \begin{block}{}
        To mitigate the effectiveness of these attacks, it is possible to:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{SPA}: avoid branches with conditions that depend on secret data
            \item \textbf{DPA}: \textit{mask} the secret data when performing operations on them
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Masking}
        Given a secret $x$, we can split it into $d$ \textit{shares} in such a way that
        \begin{equation*}
            x = x_0 \odot x_1 \cdots \odot x_{d-1}
        \end{equation*}
        for some operation $\odot$ (e.g. XOR in binary fields).
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Securing AND gates}
    \begin{block}{Probing Model}
        Given a logic circuit, an attacker can attach a number of probes on the paths between logic gates.
        
    \end{block}
